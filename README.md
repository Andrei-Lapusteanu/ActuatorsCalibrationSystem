# ActuatorsCalibrationSystem

## Summary

 Windows application which using image processing algorithms can determine the movement behaviour of a set of mechanical actuators. This application represents my bachelor's project
 
### Scope
- This application is part of the **ELI-NP (Extreme Light Infrastructure-Nuclear Physics)** project - [http://www.eli-np.ro/ro/](http://www.eli-np.ro/ro/)


## Technologies

- Mostly written using **C#**, using the **.NET framework**
- UI was designed in **WPF/XAML**
- Its backbone is a modified **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** design pattern, to which an **Entites** project was added
- **OpenCVSharp** was used in order to implement the image processing requirements
- Basic logging was implemented using **log4net**
